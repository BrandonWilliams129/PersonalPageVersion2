# Minimalist Personal Site

This is a simple, grayscale personal website built with only HTML and CSS. No JavaScript, frameworks, or layout libraries are used. The code is clean and easy to edit by hand.

## Structure

- `projects.html` — Projects
- `music.html` — Music
- `reading.html` — Reading List
- `about.html` — About
- `style.css` — Shared minimalist grayscale styles

## Editing
- Edit the HTML files directly to update content.
